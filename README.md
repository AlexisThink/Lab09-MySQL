All homework it's done, the databases and queries have ready and working... If you want it can copy this (the code it's completely free and Open Source) but I can't understand this for you.

...::: SHORT TIPS FOR YOU :::...

- Find on Google
- Read the questions of Stackoverflow
- Read the(amazing) post that you find in "Medium"
- Try it for yourself until you succed

If you dont have succes after all, read the code... try to understand every single part of them. 
The victory about of do the work its understand, not only finish
